## How To Use <br />
### Number Calculator <br />
The number calculator portion accepts all valid expressions. <br />
However, it works from left to right and does not take the order of operations into account. <br />

### Grade Calculator <br />
The grade calculator is shown by pressing mode. <br />
If the square root curve is checked, then a square root curve is applied. <br />
The formula for that is $\sqrt{grade}*10$ <br />
